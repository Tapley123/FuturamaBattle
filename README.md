# FuturamaBattle
A recreation of the futurama space battle from the episode Benders big score. I used probuilder in unity to model low poly poly ships for this project.

The first scene will show all of the ships in a v flock shape shooting the first golden death star.

The bullets will all target the same target on the deathstar to make this pattern.

Scene 2 will follow the gang ship shooting at another deathstar with a tommy gun.

Scene 3 will show a few of the ships doing the banking steering behaviour.

The globetrotters ship will shoot basketballs at another one of the deathstars.

This is an image of the planet express ship that I have modeled using probuilder


Instructions.
Press Play!

How it Works?
Completely automatic. The scene will play entirely unassisted while using cinemachine to get different camera angles.

What I am most proud of?
I am proud that I was able to accomplish this using only one scene in unity as I coded a very clever AI for the ships using state machines. And I am very proud of the 3d models I made for this project. I modeled the planet express ship, mob ship(Black ship) and Globetrotter ship (UFO basketball ship).

I also wrote all of the code myself.
